### The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with NGINX, and practice creating a microservice backend. 
### When scanning through the NGINX docs I found this photo <img width="1024" alt="deploy-NGINX-API-gateway-pt1_topology" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105041614/231921611-cfca4b48-5bb9-4f40-b415-1776166a6576.png">
### I decided to use this image as inspiration for a project to learn more about configuring NGINX as an API Gateway.
